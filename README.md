# dynamic-stack-c
This is a very basic implementation of a stack in C.<br>
Start by calling **stack->create()** and then proceed to use **push()** or **pop()** as much as you wish.<br>
The program handles memory reallocation for you but remember to call **stack->destroy()** when exiting from your program.<br>
Arguments to push() and pop() are void pointers to allow usage with arbitary data types.<br>

The program is very simplistic just check the examples to understand how everything works.<br>
